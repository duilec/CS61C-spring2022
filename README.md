## labs

### lab00

start time: *22.10.28*

end time: *22.10.29*

**keeping patience~**

### lab01

start time: *22.11.14*

end time: *22.11.15*

In C, if we would change the value of the original something (ie. already existing)
we should use it's pointer/address in called function

- eg1. if we would change the value of the `int` we should pass `int*`
- eg2. if we would change the value(pointer) of the `void*` we should pass `void**`

### lab02

start time: *22.11.19*

end time:*22.11.19*

- about `realloc()`

  ```c
  /* note: malloc() will return a address */
  /* note: realloc() will return a address */
  int *p
  /* allocate memory, you should use '20 * sizeof(int)' NOT '20' */
  p = (int*)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
  ...
  /* reallocate memory, you should use '20 * sizeof(int)' NOT '20' */
  p = (int*)realloc(p, 20 * sizeof(int));
  ```
  
- about `malloc()`

  ```c
  int* int_ptr;
  int_ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
  
  /* note: use sizeof(node) NOT sizeof(node*),
  	 becasue sizeof(node*) == 4 BUT sizeof(node) maybe != 4 */
  node* node_ptr;
  node_ptr = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));
  ```


### lab03

start time: *22.11.28*

end time: *22.11.29*

***ps1: my solution maybe different with official requirement***

***ps2: I don't delete `YOUR CODE HERE` in this lab, but I surly finished***

exercise 2

- if your computer have small screen, you may need shrink your browser by `ctrl + middle mouse button`  to having good experience of debug

exercise 5

- if you using **recursion** in RISC-V(or other assembly language), **you need do lots of actions of restoring value in stack**

## projects

### proj1

start time: *22.11.20*

end time:*22.11.23*

use `fseek`ï¼Œ`ftell` and `rewind` to get length of string 

  ```c
  /* get the length of A string in A file */
  
  // seek position of ending(it is '\0'?) in f
  fseek(f, 0, SEEK_END);
  // get the current position(the ending of position) 
  long f_len = ftell(f);
  // rewind to the beginning of position in f
  rewind(f);
  ```

Modify variable **by passing pointer**

endless recursion will cause `segmentfault`

Conditional Inclusion

- `#ifndef`

  ```c
  /* 
   * frame
   */
  #ifndef HDR 
  #define HDR 
  /* contents of hdr.h go here */ 
  #endif
  
  /* 
   * example
   */
  #define YEARS_OLD 12
  #ifndef YEARS_OLD
  #define YEARS_OLD 10
  #endif
  ```

- `#ifdef`

  ```c
  /* 
   * frame
   */
  #ifdef macro_definition
  
  /* 
   * example
   */
  #include <stdio.h>
  #define UNIX 1
  
  int main(){
     #ifdef UNIX
     printf("UNIX specific function calls go here.\n");
     #endif
     return 0;
  }
  ```
  
- `#if`, `#else`, `#elif`

  ```c
  #if SYSTEM == SYSV 
  	#define HDR "sysv.h" 
  #elif SYSTEM == BSD 
  	#define HDR "bsd.h" 
  #elif SYSTEM == MSDOS 
  	#define HDR "msdos.h" 
  #else 
  	#define HDR "default.h" 
  #endif 
  #include HDR
  ```

### proj2

start time: *22.11.29*

end time:*22.12.07*

total time: 11hour 50min

not work time: *22.12.1, 22.12.3 - 22.12.06*

`callee`&`caller`

- `callee register` mean that callee don't use it, if calllee would use it, you must store it in stack, then restore from stack(i.e. callee save)
- `caller register ` mean that caller don't use it, if caller would use it, you must store it in stack, then restore from stack(i.e caller save)
- `ra` is `caller register ` BUT we should store it in callee because we may call other function which will modify `ra` 
- any function can be caller, caller or callee and caller at same time

`error_malloc` better than `error_code_26`

- because you can know the reason of error

Some functions NOT return value, BUT they change some value by pointer of passing

- eg. `matmul`

hint in `test_chain`

- the width of input matrix may **NOT** equals `1`
